# DeepResUNet for Camouflaged Object Detection

A PyTorch implementation of a Deep Residual U-Net architecture for detecting camouflaged objects in images. This model leverages the power of deep convolutional neural networks with skip connections to accurately segment objects that blend with their surroundings.

## Overview

Camouflaged object detection is a challenging computer vision task where the goal is to identify objects that are designed to blend with their environment. This repository implements a Deep Residual U-Net architecture that combines the strengths of residual learning and the U-Net architecture to create a powerful segmentation model for this task.

The network is trained to generate pixel-wise binary masks that highlight camouflaged objects in natural images, making it useful for applications in wildlife monitoring, military operations, and computer vision research.

## Architecture

The model follows a U-Net architecture with the following components:

- **Encoder Path**: A series of downsampling operations with double convolutions to extract features
- **Decoder Path**: A series of upsampling operations with skip connections to restore spatial resolution
- **Skip Connections**: Connect corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder paths
- **Output Layer**: Final convolution to generate the segmentation mask

Each convolutional block includes:
- Two 3×3 convolutional layers
- Batch normalization
- ReLU activation

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-res-unet-camouflage.git
cd deep-res-unet-camouflage
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Structure

The code expects the dataset to be organized as follows:

```
/path/to/dataset/
│
├── Images/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
│
└── GT/
    ├── mask1.png
    ├── mask2.png
    └── ...
```

Where:
- `Images/` contains the input RGB images
- `GT/` contains the corresponding ground truth binary masks

## Usage

### Training

To train the model on your dataset:

```python
# Import the model and dataset
from res_unet import DeepResUNet
import torch

# Create the model
model = DeepResUNet(in_channels=3, out_channels=1)

# Train the model
# See res_unet_with_data.py for complete training code
```

### Inference

To use the trained model for inference:

```python
# Load a trained model
model = DeepResUNet(in_channels=3, out_channels=1)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_weights.pth'))
model.eval()

# Prepare your image
# transform = ...
# image = ...

# Inference
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(image)['output']
    predicted_mask = torch.sigmoid(output) > 0.5
```
